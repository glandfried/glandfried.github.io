The ergodicity problem is common to:
    - Evolutionary Biology
    - Cultural evolution tehory
    - Decision Theory
    - Political Economics

In all thgis fields, we make use of mathematics to analyze what happens to 
individual agents over time. For this purpose we represent the real environment
through a stochastic function.

The question now is how to analyse the stochastic function in order to find the
expected outcome, what will happen to agents typically.

The original treatment (Pascal-Fermat-Huygens) states that the expected outcome
can be found by multiplying each possible change in size by its probability of 
occurrence, and add everything, i.e. the aritmetc mean.

This model doesnâ€™t fir human behavior, and that was noticed early. People did
not follow the aritmetc mean. A categorical example is the St.Petersburg
paradox.

The modern Utility Theory born to fix the problems of the original treatment.
In 1738 Daniel Bernoulli introduce the utility function over wealth, $u(x)$, to
encodes the different preferences individuals. In general, the utility (i.e. 
particular preference) of extra wealth is roughly inversely proportional to how
many wealth one already has. This leads to a diferential change in utility 

$$du = 1/w dw$$

with solution

$$u(w) = ln w$$.

    plt.xlabel("Wealth", fontsize=16 )

"""
The Utility Theory considers that it is preferable to participate in this game
when the expected value is positive. Then, the Utility Theory systematically
observed how people acted contrary to what was considered optimal. Paired with 
a firm belief in its models, this has led to a narrative of human irrationality
in large parts of economics.

But if we analyze what really 

This is because we are facing a multiplicative process.
When the asymmetry between real physical effects of gains and losses is large, people quite reasonably 'pay to avoid losses' (e.g. buy insurance).
When it is not large, people don't unreasonably mind losses, and won't pay to avoid them.
