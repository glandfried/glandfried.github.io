      <description>To explain why major evolutionary transitions are so common in the history of life we need to find the causes that systematically generate the irreversible emergence of cooperation and specialization. For this purpose it is necessary to consider selection at both the individual and group level. The co-author of the concept of major evolutionary transitions (Szathmáry) recently proposed to analyze the evolution of populations subject to multilevel selection by means of Bayesian hierarchical models, making use of the isomorphism between evolutionary theory and Bayesian inference.</description>

      <description>Most estimators implemented for the video game industry cannot obtain reliable initial estimates nor guarantee comparability between distant estimates. TrueSkill Through Time solves all these problems by modeling the entire history of activities using a single Bayesian network. This algorithm requires a few iterations to converge, allowing millions of observations to be analyzed using any low-end computer.
To support the use of reliable learning estimators, we provide the first implementations of TrueSkill Through Time for Julia, Python and R.</description>

Última versión 2021-07-26  TrueSkillThroughTime.jl None of the commonly used skill estimators, such as TrueSkill, Glicko and Item-Response Theory, correctly models the temporal aspect, which prevents having both good initial estimates and comparability between estimates separated in time and space.
TrueSkill Through Time corrects those biases by modeling the entire history of activities using a single Bayesian network.</description>

      <title>TrueSkill, Technical Report</title>

      <description>The first skill estimator was developed by Arpad Elo, adopted by the World Chess Federations around 1970. TrueSkill is just the bayesian multiplayer version of Elo model, published by Microsoft in 2007. In this technical report I derive, step by step, the analytical solution of the model.</description>
