With some colleagues, we are working to lay the foundations of an interdisciplinary social sciences research center in Latin America. The construction of explanatory models of social phenomena is a central goal of our proposal and our interest, which drives us to search for methodologies, new or old, that enhance the results of our research and developments. We only hope that our work will benefit communitarian historical projects that prioritize life over profitability.\nLines of Work  Science as an intercultural project of intersubjective agreements Bayesian inference as the way to compute honest beliefs Culture as transgenerational information, a product of a non-ergodic system Patriarchal-colonial-modernity as a destructive force of adapted knowledge Polycentric governance as the only means for ecological re-adaptation  Empathy is the cognitive skill that allowed the development of Homo sapiens: mutual understanding, imitation, language and finally culture. Intellectual honesty is a generalization of empathy on which the (ideal of) scientific development is based, a principle common to the entire human species. Only recently have it been discovered which rules allow as to compute honest-beliefs distributions, ensuring consistent and optimal reasoning in contexts of uncertainty given the available information. While these formalisms are a useful tool for the intercultural project of intersubjective agreements, it is the transgenerational information produced by societies (culture) that is the only one ecologically adapted. The current ecological crisis is preceded by an era of genocide and cultural loss, and is being aggravated by the advance of state-private institutions of the patriarchal-colonial-modern front over local autonomies, preventing communities from developing their own institutions. In a world of uprooted individuals, a pedagogy of cruelty manages to introduce the typical psychopathic structure of our times based on instrumental desire: nature as a thing, people as things. Systems that are out of equilibrium, such as the ecological one, offer a physical advantage for cooperation. Rescuing domestic policy, its negotiation, representation and management styles, a knowledge accumulated by women in their condition as a differentiated group of the species, is essential to face the ecological crisis.\n","date":1581292800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1581292800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://glandfried.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Know in such a way that you can put in univocal correspondence the phenomena perceived by your consciousness with some scheme of operation that is publicly intelligible and reproducible (Juan Samaja)\nNote to spanish-speaking readers:\n 1/5 del trabajo se dona a organizaciones comunitarias que lo demanden acompañamos a estudiantes en ciencias sociales que requieran formación  As a Social Anthropologist, finishing a PhD in Computer Science, I consider the social sciences as an other empirical science, subject to the same commitment to understand, explain and predict for the general welfare.","tags":null,"title":"Gustavo Landfried","type":"authors"},{"authors":["mocskos"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"7bb594d4a6853e76f6eb271566f619e6","permalink":"https://glandfried.github.io/authors/mocskos/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/mocskos/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Esteban Mocskos","type":"authors"},{"authors":["slezak"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"87361c8736f5db02ab9f3f6df73f5555","permalink":"https://glandfried.github.io/authors/slezak/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/slezak/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Diego Fernandez Slezak","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Gustavo Landfried"],"categories":[],"content":"It was considered an established truth that cooperation required some kind of altruistic behavior to evolve. Indeed, one of the most important theorists of the evolution of cooperation, Martin Nowak, analyzed in one of the most prestigious scientific journals, Nature, a set of relevant rules for the evolution of cooperation. All the rules summarized a benefit-to-cost ratio of an altruistic act with respect to some critical value. At the end of the paper, he claimed that the most remarkable aspect of evolution is its ability to generate cooperation in a competitive world. We will see that his surprise can only arise if we are implicitly assuming that evolutionary systems are ergodic. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what does ergodic mean, read on.\nEvolutionary processes are essentially temporary processes. In evolutionary theory everyone is taught the fact that lineage growth is a multiplicative and noisy process: a sequence of survival and reproductive probabilities. In the field, we make use of mathematics to analyze what happens to a genetic or cultural lineage over time. For this purpose we represent the real environment through a stochastic function. For example, consider the following toy environment. Nature tosses a coin. For heads your community grows 50% of its current size. For tails your community lose 40% of its members.\ndef environment(size): if np.random.random() \u0026lt;= 0.5: res = 1.5*size else: res = 0.6*size return res The question, now, is how to analyze the stochastic function in order to find the expected outcome, i.e. what will happen to agents typically. The development of probability theory was motivated by this purpose.\nThe original treatment (Pascal-Fermat-Huygens) states that the expected outcome can be found by multiplying each possible change in size by its probability of occurrence, and add everything. Let $\\Delta(s)$ be the change in size at state $s$ and $p(s)$ the probability of state $s$, then the expected outcome will be:\n$$\\text{expected outcome} = \\sum_s p(s)\\Delta(s)$$\nIf we analyze the toy environment, we will find that the expected outcome will have a positive change, $0.05\\Delta = 0.5 \\times 0.5\\Delta + 0.5 \\times (-0.4)\\Delta$. However, even if we consider members as a continuous variable, what really happens over time is very different from what is expected.\nThe expectation over states does not reflect what really happens with the individual agents over time. This is because we are facing a multiplicative process (Yaarin 2010). In the multiplicative process the real physical impacts of losses are often stronger than those of gains. If there is even one zero in the sequence of generations, we are extinct. Comparing what happens over time to what happens in expectation is a well-known problem in statistical mechanics, called \u0026ldquo;the ergodicity problem\u0026rdquo;. A system is ergodic if its time average equals its expectation value.\nOne consequence is that variance in fitness realy matters. An effective way to reduce variance is to cooperate, by sharing members between communities. The anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss developed a general argument for the universality of the incest taboo in human societies. His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against endogamy, and the effect is to encourage exogamy. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity.\nTo experiment the effect of this kind of rules, we define a toy incest taboo rule, in which a percentage of the community must migrate to other unrelated housholds.\ndef incest_rule(communities_size,exogamy=0.05): res = [] migration_per_community = exogamy*sum(communities_size)/len(communities_size) for c in range(len(communities_size)): res.append( communities_size[c]*(1-exogamy) + migration_per_community ) return res If the previous communities, in the same environment, applied a 5% of exogamy we would observe the following behavior.\nMultiplicative process offers a concrete physical advantage in favor of cooperative behavior. The \u0026ldquo;ergodic\u0026rdquo; point of view had major implications for all evolutionary science. Perhaps the most significant change lies in the nature of the model human that arises from our conceptual reframing (Peters 2019). Observed behaviour deviates starkly from the predictions made by the Homo economicus model. Paired with a firm belief in its models, this has led to a narrative of human irrationality in large parts of economics. If humans evolved in non-ergodic environments they should be able to intuitively evaluate and adapt to the temporal consequences of the different scenarios, as the Copenhagen experiment seems to have shown (Meder 2019). The new \u0026ldquo;Homo ergodicus\u0026rdquo; model is a better fit to human behavior, who tends to care about others, understands that cooperation leads to better results, and is patient and kind.\nReferences  Nowak, M. 2006.

The most referenced article about Bayesian statistics [1] focuses on this result as a practical tool of applied statistics. There are good texts, sach as [2], with several examples that allow us to appreciate how it works.\nTo my surprise I found in the most cited Handbook on Bayesian inference [3], only a single reference on this method, discouraging its use! And of the only page that he spent on that really big book, the only thing I could get out is a reference to a discussion [4-5] that this author had in 1994.\n   Robert Kass and Adrian Raftery. Bayes Factors. 1995. Journal of the American Statistical Association.    Tom Minka. Bayesian linear regression. 1998. (from personal web)    Gelman et al. Bayesian Data Analysis. 2013. Chapman and Hall/CRC    Adrian Raftery. Bayesian Model Selection in Social Research (with Discussion). 1995. Sociological Methodology.    Andrew Gelman and Donald Rubin. Avoiding Model Selection in Bayesian Social Research. 1995. Sociological Methodology.    After having read this discussion, I personally have no doubt that Raftery was right. The arguments can be found in the texts, cited above, that I would like you to also read firsthand. However, we can also mention some \u0026ldquo;context reasons\u0026rdquo;. Twenty-five years later we can count the references that each position received, and in this respect there is also a clear winner. In addition, the attitude of Gelman to avoid the subject in his Handbook, offering only the reference to the discussion, does not seem anything other than a sign of defeat.\nEvidence in favor of a scientific theory To compute the evidence that a specific data set D provides in favor of a specific model $M_k$, we need to solve\n$$ P(M_k|D)$$\nwhich by definition of conditional probability is\n$$ P(M_k|D) = \\frac{P(D|M_k)P(M_k)}{\\sum_i P(D|M_i)P(M_i)} $$\nBut, if we only want to compare models, it is enough to compute their evidence ratio, which simplify the formula to\n$$\\frac{P(M_1|D)}{P(M_2|D)} = \\frac{P(D|M_1)}{P(D|M_2)}\\frac{P(M_1)}{P(M_2)}$$\nOverlooking the omnipresent prior definition, the model selection depends only on the \u0026ldquo;marginal likelihood\u0026rdquo; of each model, an element that we compute every time in bayesian inference!!\n$$\\text{Bayes factor}=\\frac{P(D|M_1)}{P(D|M_2)}$$\nBayesian model selection uses the rules of probability theory to select among different hypotheses. It automatically encodes a preference for simpler, more constrained models, as illustrated below. Simple models, e.g. linear regression, only fit a small fraction of data sets. But they assign correspondingly higher probability to those data sets. Flexible models spread themselves out more thinly.\nA central issue in polynomial fitting is selecting the degree of the polynomial. To do this, we compute the probability of the data for each possible degree. For a given degree, this requires integrating over all possible polynomial fits, which can be done analytically. The results are shown below.\nThe likelihood only considers the single most probable curve, as shown for each degree. The likelihood is the negative squared-error of the fit. It always increases with increasing degree. But the evidence reaches a maximum at degree 3, which happens to be the true degree in this case. The data is much more likely to have arisen from a third-degree polynomial than a high-degree polynomial which just happened to look third-degree.\n","date":1560038400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560038400,"objectID":"7e95b4b9d48c007988c9f9490ea5fddd","permalink":"https://glandfried.github.io/post/bayesfactor/","publishdate":"2019-06-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bayesfactor/","section":"post","summary":"Bayesian Model Selection","tags":[],"title":"Raftery - Gelman debate 25 years later","type":"post"},{"authors":["Gustavo Landfried"],"categories":[],"content":"Playing as a team with same partners enable us to early acquire individual skills that would hardly be achieved by playing alone.
