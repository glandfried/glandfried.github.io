      <description>The only agents capable of developing successful solutions to complex problems are the peoples in the evolution of their history (Rita Segato, Elinor Ostrom, Robert Boyd). The advance of the colonial-modern front, today under the figure of the Republican States and private enterprises, destroys much of the cultural diversity accumulated over thousands of years by human populations. It is therefore necessary to restore the jurisdictional and deliberative autonomy of peoples in order to guarantee the process of cultural evolution, the only means capable of solving the serious ecological and economic problems that humanity faces today.</description>
